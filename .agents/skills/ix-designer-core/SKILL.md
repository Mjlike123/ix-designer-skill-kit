description: Platform-neutral interaction design workflow that turns PRDs, documents, screenshots, design files, URLs, or conversation into traceable requirements, UX/UI specifications, and component-aligned functional prototypes. Use with one business profile and one agent adapter; never assume a specific design system, repository, or tool provider.

# IX Designer Core

This Skill owns the reusable interaction-design method. It does not own brand rules, component names, repository paths, or tool syntax.

## Required composition

Before execution, resolve:

1. **Business profile** — design-system sources, product terminology, output policy, prototype policy, and review gates.
2. **Agent adapter** — available capabilities and the concrete tools that provide them.
3. **User request** — scope, target platform, expected fidelity, and requested deliverables.

Read `references/composition-contract.md`. Stop only when a required capability has no adapter and no documented fallback.

## Invariants

- Preserve source traceability and confidence. Never turn inference into fact.
- Separate user-visible behavior, unchanged context, visual direction, and implementation detail.
- Search the active business profile before inventing components, Tokens, patterns, or page structures.
- Reuse the profile's components and interaction patterns when they satisfy the intended semantics.
- Record uncovered component, page, visual, or interaction behavior as an explicit gap.
- Keep UX decisions independent from Agent-platform tool syntax.
- Generate production code only when the active profile and user authorization allow it.

## Six-phase workflow

### 0. Ingest

Use the adapter capability matching each input: `document.read`, `pdf.read`, `image.inspect`, `design.read`, `url.fetch`, or `conversation.read`.

Normalize sources into `RequirementBrief` using `specs/requirement-brief.schema.yaml`. For multiple sources, merge by feature and page identity; preserve conflicts.

### 1. Frame the requirement

Classify every relevant statement:

- `newBehavior`
- `existingModified`
- `existingUnchanged`
- `visualDirection`
- `designImpact`
- `ignoredItem`
- `uncertain`

Translate technical and operational statements into UX constraints when they affect loading, errors, permissions, compatibility, content priority, moderation, localization, or perceived performance.

Present the page inventory, primary flow, assumptions, and open questions. Apply the profile's confirmation gate.

### 2. Research

When the feature uses a mature pattern or the user asks for references:

1. Search the profile's internal knowledge sources.
2. Search external sources only when policy and adapter permit it.
3. Separate observed evidence from recommendations.
4. Produce `adopt`, `avoid`, and `needsValidation`.

Do not copy competitor visuals or protected assets.

### 3. Model interaction and UI

Use `specs/interaction-spec.schema.yaml`.

For every page and overlay define:

- purpose, entry, exit, and terminal conditions;
- default, loading, success, empty, error, disabled, permission, and offline states when applicable;
- semantic elements and accessible names;
- trigger → transition → feedback → result;
- dismiss, cancellation, recovery, focus, keyboard, localization, and reduced-motion behavior.

Before proposing UI, query the profile in this order:

1. existing full page or flow;
2. shared business module;
3. design-system component and interaction pattern;
4. Foundation Token and accessible primitive;
5. isolated prototype gap.

Write the result to `designSystemMapping`; include source identifiers and gaps.

### 4. Review and improve

Review:

- task completion and information architecture;
- consistency with the active design system;
- state and transition completeness;
- accessibility and localization;
- failure recovery and destructive actions;
- feasibility and scope integrity.

Classify changes as `design-completion`, `ux-improvement`, or `needs-product-confirm`. Do not silently change product policy.

### 5. Deliver

Use output locations and formats from the business profile. Default deliverables:

- human-readable UX design document;
- machine-readable interaction specification;
- runnable functional prototype when `prototype.render` is available and authorized;
- optional brief, research, review report, or wireframes.

The prototype must use the active profile's real components, Tokens, and interaction contracts where available. Validate rendered behavior, not source code alone.

## Capability fallback

- Missing proprietary document reader → request export as text, PDF, or images.
- Missing design-file reader → use exported frames plus documented variables.
- Missing repository access → produce mapping requirements, not fabricated component IDs.
- Missing prototype renderer → deliver interaction spec and implementation-ready component mapping.
- Missing browser/runtime verification → mark rendered measurements as unverified.

## Handoff

Report:

- active profile and adapter;
- sources and confidence;
- pages and primary flow;
- reused pages/modules/components/Tokens/patterns;
- unresolved gaps and decisions;
- generated artifacts;
- validation evidence and unavailable checks.
